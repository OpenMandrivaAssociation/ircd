ircd 2.11.1-p1 update notes

Major changes in /etc/ircd/ircd.conf:
- M: has a new mandatory field: SID, for example 000A
- I: requires now both name field and addr field to match,
  but if <TARGET Hosts NAME> is not empty (even if "*"), the client is
  required to have DNS
  "I:*::::::" will allow any client to connect
